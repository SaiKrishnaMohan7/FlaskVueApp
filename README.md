# Sources
All over the internet but the following IMO are worth metntioning:

* Mbithe Nzomo
    * She has some great tutorials on Scotch.io and [this](decodegirl.com/) is her website.

* Justin Mayer
    * Had a good explanation of Virtualenvs and how its a good idea to have a venv for every project. [This] (https://hackercodex.com/guide/python-development-environment-on-mac-osx/) what I used for understanding and setting up this environment.
